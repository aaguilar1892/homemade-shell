## Compilation Methods

### Makefile

A Makefile is included in the repository. The purpose of this file is to facilitate the compilation process. To execute the compilation process, use the command `make`.

To clean up any files that were created in the process, use `make clean`.

### Manual Terminal Compilation

To compile the files manually from the terminal, you will have to type out the complete string command. The command is:

`...`

Executing the command will create an executable file called bitwisemenu.

To execute it, type `...` into the terminal.

## Known Issues

Currently no issues are known. Issues may arise as we further develop this project.
